According to the SCPAFF summary report (meeting 5 October 2020): The level of 1ppm for aloe-emodin/emodin and the level of 1 ppm for the sum of aloin A and aloin B are for the time being the lowest levels that can be reliably quantified in laboratories across the EU and can therefore be put forward as limits of quantification (LOQ) in an EU harmonised risk management approach. Products ready for use after preparation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions containing an analysed level higher than or equal to 1 ppm aloe-emodin and/or 1 ppm emodin and/or 1 ppm aloin A + aloin B provide clear evidence of presence of these substances in the products. The sum of the analysed contents of aloin A and aloin B can be used to quantify the total HAD content in preparations from the leaf of Aloe species. According to the EURL’s report on the available analytical methods for the quantification of HADs, methods typically do not include danthrone, which is a synthetic HAD, not supposed to be present in the plant materials.
Concretely, only the preparations from the leaf of Aloe species containing less than 1 ppm aloe-emodin, 1 ppm emodin and 1 ppm aloin A + aloin B could continue to be marketed (the LOQs apply to the product ready for use after preparation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions).","Emodin (< 1 ppm),Aloe-emodin (< 1 ppm),Aloin A + aloin B (< 1 ppm),Danthron (= 0 ppm)",,,,,,,,,
